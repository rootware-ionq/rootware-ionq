#  Hi, I'm Shah 👋
I'm a new hire at IonQ, working on the system architecture & performance team.

I'm a quantum physicist who likes the interface of math, physics and programming. Specifically, I like interfacing machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques with quantum algorithms.

I have worked on a motley of topics in the past, and am excited to chat about all of them, including quantum sensing, quantum computing, quantum information theory, physics informed machine learning, and using reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks to augment quantum algorithms and design tasks (see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dpsqpvYAAAAJ) ) 

On the programming side, I love coding hobby projects here and there. I use Python, Mathematica and C++ for work, and Rust for personal projects. My obsession with Rust is a bit recent, and am fascinated about its applicability to scientific computing. In the past, I have also used Fortran, Matlab, Java and R.

My personal website (in progress) can be found [here](https://rootware.github.io/).

## ⭐ Selected Projects from my personal website
- Interpreting convolutional neural networks and using them as a variational quantum algorithm for qubit systems [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.7.013094)
- Using reinforcement learning to optimize design of quantum sensors and circuits [Sample Github 1](https://github.com/rootware/lattice_evolution),  [Sample Github 2](https://github.com/rootware/BayesianData) used for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07907).
- Playing around with Rust and C++ interfacing, since the RL used for my publications is in C++ and the physics simulations are usually in Rust.
- Implementing my own custom DDQN in Rust using the Burh API. Goal is to make physics informed RL in Rust for my Rust physics projects (ongoing project) [Github](https://github.com/rootware/Reinforcement_Learning_DQN_using_Burn)
- Using Neural Networks to Solve Hamiltonians [Demo](https://github.com/rootware/RBM-for-Quantum-Spin-Hamiltonians)
- Using the Bevy game engine to visualize animations of what my RL agents are doing
